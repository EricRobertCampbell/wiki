= aiohttp =
An asynchronous http request (&c.) library

{{{python
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
	async with session.get(url) as resp:
		#do stuff with the response
}}}

- Useful stuff:
	- `resp.status` - the status number (200, &c)
	- `resp.url` - the actual URL that was sent
	- `await resp.text()` - the text of the response. For an HTML page, this is the HTML as a string
	- `await resp.json()` - the *parsed* json object
	- `await resp.read()` - the response as bytes (for non-text)

{{{javascript
import React from 'react';

import { Router, Link } from "@reach/router";

let Home = () => (
	<div>
		<h1>Home</h1>
		<nav>
			<Link to="/">Home</Link>{" | "}
			<Link to="dashboard">Dashboard</Link>

- Links WILL NOT treat fragments as part of the path, nor will they process them as variables! (so `/path` and `/path/#fragment` will be treated the same!)

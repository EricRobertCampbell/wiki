== Notes ==
- Get a developer account at the [developer portal](https://developer/salesforce.com)

=== Using the API ===
- Test queries in the Developer Console (Homepage -> [Gear] -> [Developer Console])
- REST API
- `curl https://yourInstance.salesforce.com/data/services/data`
- For a client to have access to the API, it needs to be authorized as a safe visitor
- Do so by using a Connected App
	1. [Setup] -> [Apps] -> [App Manager] -> New Connected App
	2. Fill out the information
	3. Add the OAuth authorizations
	4. CORS?
- When using the connected app, for the callback URL you seem to need to use the port: `https://localhost:3000`
- To avoid CORS problems, you have to use the setting:
	- [Setup] -> (Search for CORS) -> Add a rule (e.g. `https://localhost`)
- You can access the secret &c. through [Setup] -> [Apps] -> [App Manager]
- When making the call, make sure that the client ID 
- [API Reference](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/resources_list.htm)
- `https://yourOrg.salesforce.com/services/data/sobjects` - a listing of all of the objects
{{{javascript 
{
	...
		sobjects: [
		{
			...
			properties of the object...
			...
			name: This is how you refer to it! (Corresponds to 'API Name')
		}
		]
}
}}}
- You can add an object by just sending a request to the REST enpoint with method post and the data 
- Edit an object by sending a request to the REST endpoint associated with the ID of that object
- Lots more examples [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/using_resources_working_with_records.htm)
- Example of using an authorization endpoint to authorize can be found [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2015/08/creating-jquery-application-using-rest-api.html)

=== Errors and How To Fix Them ===
- 400 (Bad Request) - Malformed endpoint in the request
- 401 (Unauthorized) - seems to happen mostly when I forget to submit the authorization headers
- 403 (Forbidden) - Understandable request, but was denied
	- REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED - Too many API calls! 
	- See # of API requests at [Setup] -> [Environments] -> [Monitoring] -> [System Overview]
- 405: Method not allowed
	- method (GET, POST, PATCH, &c.) is not correct for the request



=== Trailhead - Salesforcec Platform Basics ===
- App: Set of objects, fields, and other functionality the supports a business procvess
- Object: tables in the Salesforce database
	- Standard objectrs: Account, Contact, &c.
	- Custom object: one that is different?
- Records: rows in the database
- Field: columns in the database
- Org: Organization? (Specific Salesforce instance)
	- A single company can have one or multiple
- Trailhead playground (TP) - safe environment to practice
- Declarative development: declare how things should be, and let the platform take care of how that gets done
- Programmatic development: doing the actual coding
- You can edit the different objects from the [Setup] -> [Object Manager] tab (Fields and Relationships)
- AppExchange: App store for Salesforce
- There are sandbox orgs for you to test things out in 
	- The Developer Edition org is one such!

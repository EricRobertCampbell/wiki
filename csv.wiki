Docs: [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html|here]]

{{{python
import csv
with open('eggs.csv', 'r', newline='') as csvfile:
	spamreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=' ', quotechar='|')
	for row in spamreader:
		print(', '.join(row))
}}}
- to skip a line, just call `next(spamreader)`

== Reading to a Dictionary ==
You can also read each row into a dictionary
{{{python
import csv
with open('names.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
	reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile):
	for row in header:
		print(row['first_name'], row['last_name'])
}}}
- The keys are grabbed from the first row of the file, or you can pass in the `fieldnames` parameter

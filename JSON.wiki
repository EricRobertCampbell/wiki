= JSON in Python =
- Use the `json` library
- `json.dump(data, write_file)`
- You should wrap this in a context manager to open the file: `with open("file_name", "mode") as data_file:`
- `json.dumps(data)`: writes `data` as a JSON string to a string (not a file)
- to load data: `data = json.load(read_file)` 
  - Again, should be in a context manager to get `read_file`

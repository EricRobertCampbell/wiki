`import { render } from '@testing-library/react'`

- `render(JSX)`: renders the provided JSX
- `screen.debug()`: prints out a nice picture of the DOM when you run it (visible on the Jest debugging screen)
- The `screen` has various different ways of grabbing different elements:
	- `screen.getByText('Search')` looks for an element whose text content is 'Search'
- `expect(screen.getByText('Search')).toBeInTheDocument()`: check that there is a component in the DOM with that text
	- You can also pass in a regular expression instead of a string literal
- Also: `screen.getByRole()` to search by role????
- Many searches have a `queryBy` variant. The difference is that this _does not_ throw an error, so can be use to test for whether something isn't in the DOM (e.g.)

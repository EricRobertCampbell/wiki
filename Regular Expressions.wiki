= JavaScript Regular Expressions =
- Delineate regular expressions with `/expression/`
- Test for a match using `Regex.test(string)`
	- Return true (if there's a match) or false if not
- Return the actual match using `string.match(regex)`
	- Returns it in an array: `[match]`
- Special symbols:
	- `|` or (match expressions on either side. can be chained `a|b|c`)
	- `.` wildcard matches a single character
	- `[]` put a bunch of characters in there, and it will match any one of them
- Flags are characters that go after the regex `/regex/i` (like i)
	- `i`: ignore the case
	-`g`: match all occurrences, not just the first

== Getting Started ==

- `gatsby new PROJECT_NAME` - create a new project
- `gatsby develop` - starts the project development server (by default: http://localhost:8000`)
	- If you would like to listen on the local IP address: `gatsby develop --host=0.0.0.0`
- Any component defined in `/src/pages/*.js` will automatically become a page
	- The name of the javascript file becomes the address of the page: e.g. `about.js` -> `/about`
		- `404.js` is the 404 page!
	- The default export from that page is the elementhat is rendered
	- Route using the `Link` component
		- `import { link } from "gatsby"`
		- `<Link to="/contact/">Contact</Link>`
		- Just for internal linking - for external just use `<a>`

== Styling ==
- import css files into `gatsby-browser.js` in the project root directory
- You can also use css modules
	- Automatically scoped
	- Ends with `.module.css`

== Plugins ==
`gatsby-config.js`
